# EBDP
EternalBlue / DoublePulsar

Having some fun.

## Personalize your OWN

The binary itself will check if an XML file exists with the same filename of the executable
(clearly without extension)

**For example**: *EternalBlue.exe* will look in the same directory for: *EternalBlue.xml*

(same for *DoublePulsar* obv)
